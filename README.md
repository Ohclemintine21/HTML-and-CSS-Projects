# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

An overview of a few HTML and CSS Projects I completed during my time at The Tech Academy. 
During this course I gained the knowledge of how to work with Front End code and how the designed code translates to a webpage.
Below, are snippets of code projects I worked on during the course. I throughly enjoy working with Front End code and find it fun to work with.

I was also very proud of the Portfolio site I created which can be viewed in the Repository.
